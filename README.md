# Rapid-Maze-RL
A reinforcement learning group project to replicate the findings of Rosenberg et al. (2021), implementing Q-learning for rapid maze navigation. It explores cognitive mapping, spatial memory, and adaptive behaviour in reinforcement learning agents, emphasising rapid learning without explicit spatial encoding.
